___

*Anastasia Allen has worked her entire life for a shot at Team USA. It looks like everything is going according to plan when she gets a full scholarship to the University of California, Maple Hills and lands a place on their competitive figure skating team*

*Nothing will stand in her way, not even the captain of the hockey team, Nate Hawkins*

*Nate’s focus as team captain is on keeping his team on the ice. Which is tricky when a facilities mishap means they are forced to share a rink with the figure skating team—including Anastasia, who clearly can’t stand him*

*But when Anastasia’s skating partner faces an uncertain future, she may have to look to Nate to take her shot*
